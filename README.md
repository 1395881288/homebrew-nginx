# Nginx Homebrew Tap

This tap is designed specifically for a custom build of Nginx with more module options.

## Installation

    brew tap marcqualie/nginx
    brew install marcqualie/nginx/nginx

## Why submit modules here?

Rather than submitting modules to the core Homebrew Nginx Forumla this repo will serve as a place where any module can be added and configured for custom purposes.

## What about conflicts?

You cannot install this Formula and `mxcl/master/nginx` at the same time. If there is enough demand I will change this in the future

## Credits

Credit for the original base forumla comes from https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/blob/master/Library/Formula/nginx.rb and I will keep this formula up to date with any changes made there.
